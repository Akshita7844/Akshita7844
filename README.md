## 🧠 About Me

Hi, I’m **Akshita** — a hands-on AI Engineer blending **machine learning** with **model observability**, **fairness**, and **business-ready deployment**.

I love building intelligent systems that are not just smart but also transparent, ethical, and scalable. Whether it’s monitoring AI models in real-time, extracting financial sentiment with BERT, or optimizing fraud detection — I live at the intersection of **technical innovation** and **business impact**.

🛠️ Ex-Deloitte | 💡 Built FairDeploy | 🎯 Aiming for impactful AI roles across analytics, observability, and deployment.
